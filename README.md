# CssLayoutLab

CSS Layout Lab is an interactive space to learn and experiment with the different ways of building layouts in CSS: from classic models like block and inline, to modern tools like flexbox and grid.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- Angular 19
- Rxjs 19
- SCSS

## Install dependecies

```bash
npm install
```

## Development server

To start a local development server, run:

```bash
ng serve
```

Once the server is running, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload whenever you modify any of the source files.

## Building

To build the project run:

```bash
ng build
```

This will compile your project and store the build artifacts in the `docs/` directory. By default, the production build optimizes your application for performance and speed.
